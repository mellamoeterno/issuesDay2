//abstraction in practice is like a remote control with internals that do all the job and is
//hidden from you, all you care about is pressing the right button.

//the same technique can be used in our objects  
//we can hide some of the properties from outside, giving us some benefits:
//-making the interface of the object simpler<<
//"using and understand a object with fewer properties and methods, its easier than one with several"
//
//reduce the impact of change
