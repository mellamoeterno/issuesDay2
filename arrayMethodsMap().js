//theres the following ways of going trough an array



// const array = [1,2,3,4,5,];



// for (const i of array ) {
//     document.body.innerText += i;
// }



// array.forEach(item => {
//     document.body.innerText += item;
// });

//document.body.innerText = user.address[key]

//with the map can be done a return from inside the map, different from for each.
//if i want to go through an array and return something from this array, for each is not very good for that in case.

//say that we want to go through the array, creating a new array and multiplying all of its numbers by 2x


//this one is a hard one, not a way to understand without getting better with objects arrays and overall.
